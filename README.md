# huawei-router-cwmp-success-free-internet
if you use a huawei Wireless router in your home, you can connect to the internet for free after the fair use quota expires!
log in to the router interface when the fair use quota is finished.example; (192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1, 192.168.0.1)
laterrr....
follow the actions in the video.
the goal here is just to get the cwmp success message and get the acs ok message.
I think that this vulnerability will actually occur on all wireless modems, and I proved it.
in order to achieve this process, you must constantly review the modem's log records.
in the future, such videos will come.
